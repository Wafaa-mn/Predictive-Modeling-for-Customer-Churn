# Predictive-Modeling-for-Customer-Churn
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost.

The goal wasn’t just to build models but to understand why customers leave and create a practical screening tool that flags at-risk customers for follow-up actions.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP
Dataset: WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv (included in this repo — no path change needed)

The notebook includes all steps: data cleaning, model training, evaluation, feature importance, and SHAP interpretation.
